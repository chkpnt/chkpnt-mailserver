          Email

        If your spam filter supports it, the GTUBE provides a test by which you
        can verify that the filter is installed correctly and is detecting incoming
        spam. You can send yourself a test mail containing the following string of
        characters (in upper case and with no white spaces and line breaks).

        You should send this test mail from an account outside of your network.
